1. a. Open Windows Command Prompt
b. In Windows PowerShell (Super+X, i) you can log in to the Ubuntu root account with
~wsl --user root
c. Then change the password as you usually would, i.e. for the current user (which is root) with
~passwd
or for another user with
~passwd username

a. For example to create a new user named username you would run:
~ sudo useradd username
b. To be able to log in as the newly created user, you need to set the user password. To do that run the passwd command followed by the username:
~ sudo passwd username
